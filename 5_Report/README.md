# REQUIREMENTS 


# INTRODUCTION 
- This project deals with the designing of a Blink the LED I2C driver using ATmega328.
- in most applications, however, using a Blink the LED, may not be sufficient to display the entire information, hence multiple units are connected in parallel.
- Therefore, when using a microcontroller to operate a Blink the LED, 8 pins are required to control individual LEDs in the display, which can be brought down to 4 using decoder.

# SWOT ANALYSIS 

## STRENGTH 
-  ATmega328P is a high performance yet low power consumption 8-bit AVR microcontroller.
-  that’s able to achieve the most single clock cycle execution of 131 powerful instructions thanks to its advanced RISC architecture.
-  It can commonly be found as a processor in Arduino boards such as Arduino Fio and Arduino Uno.

## weakness 
- Processors are simpler to use, with the usage of 8bit and 16bit instead of 32/64bit which are more complex.
- Readily usable without additional computing components with 32k bytes of onboard self-programmable flash program memory as well as 23 programmable I/O lines Code Efficient.
-  all 31 registers are directly connected to the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), making it 10 times faster than conventional CISC microcontrollers
- Optimized for AVR enhanced RISC instruction set

## opportunity 
ATmega328P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR enhanced RISC architecture. The ATmega328P achieves throughputs approaching 1MIPS per MHz By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle. This allows system designers to optimize power consumption versus processing speed very easily. ATMega328p is one of the famous MCUs of Atmel because of its use in the Arduino UNO board. ATmega328P is designed with low current consumption features. The chip contains 32 kilobytes of internal flash memory, 1KB of EEPROM, and 2KB of SRAM.

## THREAT 
- High up-front costs
- Performance standardization has not yet been streamlined.


# 4W & 1H 

## WHY 
- LEDs are much cooler than incandescent lights, reducing the risk of combustion or burnt fingers.

## WHAT 
- LED lighting products produce light up to 90% more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs.
- An electrical current passes through a microchip, which illuminates the tiny light sources we call LEDs and the result is visible light.

## WHEN 
- A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. 
- Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.

## WHERE
-Visible LEDs are used in many electronic devices as indicator lamps, in automobiles as rear-window and brake lights, and on billboards and signs as alphanumeric displays or even full-colour posters.

## HOW 
- An LED bulb produces light by passing the electric current through a semiconducting material the diode which then emits photons (light) through the principle of electroluminescence.
