# M1_Embbeded_Blinking the LED

LED stands for light emitting diode. In 1962, when he was 33, the scientist Nick Holonyak, Jr., created the first practical visible light-emitting diode. LED lighting products produce light up to 90% more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs. A light-emitting diode is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. LED converts electrical energy directly into light, delivering efficient light generation with little-wasted electricity. The components of an LED and the way that they generate light significantly extend the lifespan.
